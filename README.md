# Blockchain Document Verification

## Description

This project is a blockchain-based solution utilizing the Python framework Django along with Web3py. Its primary function is to verify the presence of documents in a blockchain network. If a document is not present, it is uploaded. This process is facilitated through the use of hashing to compare hashes with existing data in the blockchain system.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Using blockchain technologies for document verification and storage.
- **Document Hashing**: Automatic hashing of documents to ensure their uniqueness.
- **Smart Contracts**: Developed and implemented using Solidity language.
- **Testing**: Employing the Ganache test network for smart contract testing.

## Technologies

- **Blockchain**: For creating a reliable and secure document verification system.
- **Python & Django**: The foundation for the web application.
- **Web3py**: Integration with the Ethereum blockchain network.
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing smart contracts.
- **Ganache**: A test network for blockchain application development and testing.
